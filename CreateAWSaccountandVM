#Create a new resource group which will contain your new VM
Method - 
Go to Build a solution -
Get started with simple wizards and automated workflows.
Launch a virtual machine
With EC2 - Click this
Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
I chose the ubuntu

Free tier eligible
Select
64-bit (x86)
64-bit (Arm)
Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type

I just chose the defaults and pressed next till I reached step 6

Step 6: Configure Security Group

Create a new security group

Give a new Security group name:jenkins_wizard_6
new Description:jenkis_VM

Press Add Rule Choose Custom TCP and add 8080 as the Port
Press Next and Review and Launch

It will give a security warning ignore it 
	
it takes you to a new window 
Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair
Create a new key pair: Give a new name yourname_key

Press the Download Key Pair ( this is very important you can do this only once)(save it in a safe place)
select the I have read box and click launch

Yes you have created your new instance
Now if you go to EC2 it will take you to your running instance , you can edit the name of the instance- I made mine jenkins_master and clicked save)

Now do this same thing two more times to create a total of 3 instances - I created a jenkins_master and a slave1 and slave 2

After creating all of them 
Click the instance you want to connect to and click the connect button
this will take you to the 

EC2 Instance ID

i-xxxxxxxx (JenkinsSlave1)
Open an SSH client.
Locate your private key file. The key used to launch this instance is aws_jenkins_key.pem
Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.

chmod 400 aws_jenkins_key.pem
Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:
ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Example:
ssh -i "aws_jenkins_key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Go to your desktop terminal 
cd Downloads 
See if your aws_jenkins_key.pem is there

type chmod 400 aws_jenkins_key.pem
ssh -i "aws_jenkins_key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amaznaws.com

when using for the first time it will ask you "are you sure you want to continue connection yes/no"
press Yes
press yes and you will see your terminal prompt to change to ubuntu@IPaddress

Voila - your new vm is ready for use

Ha Ha you have reached so far now your VM is ready for use
