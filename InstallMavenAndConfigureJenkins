#Here you will learn how to download Maven and configure Maven,Git and JDK in Jenkins to build Maven jobs in Jenkins

Create an AWS VM
Configure Port 8080 for Jenkins CreatesVMInstancesinAWS document in this repo

Install Jenkins refer InstallJenkinsInAWSVM document in this repo

#Download Maven
in a new tab open https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
Download apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip ( if this downloads on your local machine instead of in the VM either download filezilla to transfer the files into the VM

or use SCP or FTP to copy the files from your local to the azure VM)

check is the zip file is dowloaded in the terminal
unzip apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip in the terminal

In Jenkins go to Manage Jenkins
Go to Global Tool Configuration
Press Maven installations
Give a Maven name (any name you want)
Give the path ( in my case it is /home/username/apache-maven-3.6.3/ to check what the path is type pwd)
untick install automatically

Press JDk installations
Give a JDK name ( any name)
Give the path ( in my case it is usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64 )(to find path type this, update-alternatives --list java 
(the path is the ones before the jdk file)
untick install automatically
if there is an error saying this is not a jdk diretory, check the path , if correct,
maybe only the jre is installed and not the jdk. so then type this command line sudo apt install default-jdk and then try again

Press Git installations
Give a Git name (I gave git)
Give the path ( in my case it is /usr/bin/git to check what the path is type which git)
untick install automatically
Save

Go to Manage Jenkins
Manage Plugins
Maven Intergration PlugIn in the available column
Click Install without Restart

Now you will be able to see the Maven Build in the Create Job section of Jenkins
Git Plugin in the manage plugins section
Click Install without Restart

Hooray now your Maven,JDK and Git is configured in Jenkins
(if JDK and Git is not installed in your VM go to the relevant documents which will guide you that is InstallGitInAWSVM and InstallJenkinsInAWSVM)
