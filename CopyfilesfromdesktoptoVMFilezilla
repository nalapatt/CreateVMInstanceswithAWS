#This document shows how to transfer files from your local desktop to the AWS VM

If you want a more user-friendly tool to transfer data, FileZilla is a good choice. 

It is free, it supports Windows/Linux/Mac systems, and it has a good user interface. It supports FTP, SFTP and other file transfer protocols.

Firstly, go to ‘https://filezilla-project.org/‘ and click “Download FileZilla Client” button to download it.

If you want to use FileZila to upload to or download data from a normal FTP server if you have the user and password

just put the information in the “Host”, “Username”, “Password” box and connect. 

However for Amazon instance, we use key-pair to log in instead of password for better safety. So it is a little bit more complicated to configure.

Open “Settings” and click “SFTP”

Click “Add keyfile...”:

Then select the ”.pem” file you used to connect to Amazon instance with ssh.

You will see the a private key has been added.

Close “Settings” and go back to the main interface.

Click button to open the site manager.

Click “New Site”.

Put the Amazon instance URL like ec2-54-166-128-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com in the “Host” box.

Set “Protocol” as “SFTP”, “Logon Type” as “Normal”, “User” as “ubuntu” and leave “Password” as blank. Then click “Connect”.

There will be a dialogue box to ask you about “Unknown host key”, just click “Ok”.

All right. Now you have logged in the Amazon instance. 

You can drag and drop to transfer the files between the remote machine and your local laptop.
