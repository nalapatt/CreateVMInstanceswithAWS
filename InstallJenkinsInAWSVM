#here you will learn how to install jenkins and use it from your local VM
Method -

Connect to your master VM
make sure that it is the master VM and not the slaves

Open up the terminal
It should go to the prompt yourusername@azure

Type in ssh username@IP_address (which is shown in the command line)
fingerprint for the first time it will ask you Yes/No 
Press Yes
now the prompt should change to username@VMname

Now you can start installing jenkins
pwd ( this will show the path) 

java -version (to confirm if java is installed)
if no version,then it is not installed, but it will give you the commands to use to install it

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless

java -version (if successful you will see the version here)

install jenkins with these commands
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add - (this will start the jenkins download)
sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list
press i (to enter insert mode)
at the end of the file paste this line (deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/)
press esc and :wq! to save and quit editor

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins (press Y to continue)

sudo systemctl status jenkins ( this will check the status of jenkins it is already running ? if inactive go to next step else skip next step)
sudo systemctl enable jenkins 

now open a new tab on your browser

your VM's public IP address)
ubuntu@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080

This will take you to the Unlock Jenkins page

Copy the path and go back to your terminal
sudo cat pathname (that you copied from the unlock jenkins page)
this will display a long password
copy that and go back to the unlock jenkins page and paste it in the password (make sure it is copied correctly without any extra spaces)

if correct it should go into the customize jenkins page

click on install suggested plugins
